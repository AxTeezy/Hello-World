# hello-world

# Hello! My name's Alex, I'm 22, & currently clueless, but trying to learn how to program. 
#
# I've been told it's good to start off in Python, so I've been working through a book for beginners in that language.
# (Learn Python The Hard Way 3rd Ed. By Zed Shaw)
#
# Right now I'm at the bit where he tells you to look through Python programs on 
# sites such as this one and try to get a little bit of a feel for it.
#
# So that's what I guess I'm doing.
